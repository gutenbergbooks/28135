<h2>THE WILD BEES' HOME.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Wild</span> bees of the wood are we;<br />
But our hive you must not see:<br />
Here behold our happy home,<br />
Where we labor, where we roam.<br />
Brooks that on their shining bosoms<br />
Catch the overhanging blossoms;<br />
Banks all bright with clustering flowers,&mdash;<br />
Here is where we pass our hours.<br />
<br />
Seldom on this solitude<br />
Does a girl or boy intrude;<br />
Few among you are aware<br />
What a home is ours, so fair!<br />
In the brook are little fish;<br />
You would like them on a dish:<br />
Keep away, and bring no hooks<br />
To these happy, murmuring brooks.<br />
<br />
You would like to find our hoard<br />
Of honey-comb and honey stored;<br />
You would track us, if you could,<br />
Through the field, and through the wood,<br />
Till, within some hollow tree,<br />
You our waxen cells could see.<br />
But beware now what you do;<br />
Treat us well, and we'll treat you.<br />

<h2>PERCY AND THE OXEN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Summer</span> came, and the city streets were dry, dusty, and
noisy, and the bricks made everybody's eyes ache.</p>

<p>So mamma took little Percy, who was only three years
old, and the rosy, fat one-year-old baby, and went away in
the steam cars to the green, fresh, cool, sunny country.
Grandpa was left all alone in the still city home, with good
old 'Titia to keep house for him until the family should
come back in the fall.</p>

<p>Well, those who could go to the country had just as
much fun as they could wish for,&mdash;sitting out under the
trees all the sunny days, and in the barn, when the sun
was too hot for them to want him to shine on them.</p>

<p>One day, great-aunt Hannah was giving her nephews
and nieces a dinner of corn and beans, and apples and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
cream, and nice bread and butter, and they all sat at the
table a long time, talking and laughing, and enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>All at once little mamma said, "Why, where's Percy?"
and sprang up, and ran to the side-door, which opened on to
the green.</p>

<p>No Percy was to be seen there: so all began to hunt
through the sitting-room, even through the parlor (where
he never played), out in the kitchen, farther out through
the long wood-shed, still farther out in the carriage-house;
but he was in none of these places.</p>

<p>Then great-aunt Hannah opened the cupboards, and
pulled out the drawers, as though she expected to find
the "grand-boy" rolled up in a napkin, and tucked away
in a corner.</p>

<p>There was a high state of flutter when mamma peeped
round the edge of the open dining-room door, and said,
"Come with me."</p>

<p>She was so smiling, that every one knew the search was
up; and a row of tall people and short people, headed by
little mamma, and ended by tall aunt Hannah, streamed out
and over the green, across the road. There they were
stopped, and told by mamma to go softly and look in one
of the barn-windows.</p>

<p>What did they see? A good load of sweet-scented hay
piled on a wide hay-cart, two big oxen yoked to that, standing
in the middle of the barn-floor, with their two great
heads held down very low.</p>

<p>In front of them was little chubby Percy, in his clean
white frock, swinging a tiny pail, that would hold a teaspoonful
of berries, in one hand, and with the other holding
out a berry to the oxen, as they put their great mouths
down to be fed.</p>

<h2>PET RABBITS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> of my little readers have owned tame rabbits; but
I doubt if they ever had for a pet the little wild rabbit who
lives in the woods, and, at the South, builds his nest above
ground.</p>

<p>On a warm, sunny afternoon in May, two little rabbits,
whose mother had been killed by a dog, were brought home
in a gentleman's pocket, and given to my little boys. They
were not old enough to feed themselves: so we put some
milk in a small bottle, and tied a piece of sponge to the
neck of it, and in that way the little things sucked up
the milk.</p>

<p>The children had a large, old-fashioned fireplace in their
room, and, after taking out the andirons, they covered the
bricks with fresh clover and grass, making a safe and snug
home for the rabbits at night. Several times a day they
were allowed to run about the lawn, and crop the sweet
white clover; and often at night, they would jump out from
their home in the fireplace, and run about the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>They were named George and Mary Rabbit, and always
used to sleep side by side. But after a few weeks they
must have felt tired of their humdrum life; for one bright
morning they ran away. I hope they are living happily
together in the fragrant woods from which they were
brought.</p>

<h2>CHIPPING-BIRDS' SONG.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
"<span class="smcap">Chipper</span>, chipper, clear the way;<br />
We must be at work to-day.<br />
See us swiftly fly along,<br />
Hear our bursts of merry song.<br />
Watch me in my busy flight,<br />
Glancing in your window bright;<br />
Save your bits of yarn for me,<br />
Just think what a help 'twould be!"<br />

<div class='poem'>
"Chip, chip, chipper!" How he sings,<br />
As he comes for shreds and strings,<br />
Which he is not slow to see,<br />
From the budding lilac-tree!<br />
Now with cunning, saucy pranks,<br />
See him nod his hearty thanks:<br />
"These are just the thing," sings he;<br />
"Truly you are helping me!"<br />
<br />
"Chipper, chipper!" See him go;<br />
Now 'tis fast, and now 'tis slow;<br />
Working ever at the nest,<br />
Never stopping once to rest;<br />
Getting little straws and strings<br />
For his good wife, while he sings,<br />
"Chip, chip, chipper, gay are we;<br />
See us in the lilac-tree!"<br />
<br />
"Chipper, chipper," all day long;<br />
Thus I hear his tuneful song,<br />
Meaning, as he flutters past,<br />
Gayly warbling, working fast,<br />
"I can't stop to talk to you;<br />
I have got my work to do:<br />
Chip, chip, chipper, clear the way;<br />
We shall finish up to-day."<br />

<h2>FOURTH OF JULY MORNING.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mat</span>, Let, and Win are the names by which three little
sisters of my acquaintance are usually called. These are
nicknames, of course. Can you guess what their real names
are?</p>

<p>Lest you should be too long about it, I will tell you: they
are Matilda, Letitia, and Winifred. Mat is the one standing
on the chair in the picture; Let is the one sitting on the
bed, with her left foot hanging down; and Win, the
youngest, is the one sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>What is the cause of all this commotion? It is only four
o'clock in the morning; but Mat and Let have rushed into
Win's room to get a good view, out of her window, of the
men firing guns out on the green. It is the Fourth of
July.</p>

<p>"Why do they wake us up so early with their bell-ringing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
their crackers, and guns?" said Let. "I hate the
Fourth of July!"</p>

<p>"She talks like a rebel," said Win. "She must be put
in prison."</p>

<p>"That is not a bad idea, Win," said Mat. "She hates
the Fourth of July, does she?&mdash;the birthday of the great
republic! She hates it!&mdash;the day that made us a nation."</p>

<p>"Yes; and I hate the stars and stripes, and all this fuss
and noise, this smell of smoke, and firing of crackers," said
Let, showing a fist.</p>

<p>"Jump up, Win, and help me arrest this rebel," said
Mat. "The country is lost if we allow such talk."</p>

<p>The next minute, the three sisters were running about
the room,&mdash;Mat and Win trying to catch poor Let, and
thrust her into the closet, which was to be her prison.
Such a stamping, such an outcry, as there was!</p>

<p>"What's all that racket there?" cried papa, at last, from
the foot of the stairs that led into his room underneath.
"Isn't there noise enough out of doors, without your shaking
the house over our heads?"</p>

<p>"Let says she hates the Fourth of July, and the old flag,"
cried Mat; "and we think she ought to be put in prison as
a rebel. We are trying to arrest her."</p>

<p>"Go to bed, every one of you, you rogues!" said papa,
"or I will put you all in prison for breaking the peace,&mdash;Where's
my big whip, mother?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you where it is, papa," cried little Win.</p>

<p>"Where, then, is it, you little darl&mdash;I mean you little
rogue?" said papa.</p>

<p>"It is where Cinderella's glass slippers are," screamed
Win. "Ask the fairies where that is."</p>

<p>What a scampering and laughing there was then!</p>

<p>Papa made a pounding with his feet on the stairs, as if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
were coming up in a great rage; but he and mamma were
laughing all the time, and so were Mat and Let,&mdash;all but
Win, and she kept a grave face.</p>

<p>It was now almost five o'clock, and the three sisters made
up their minds that they would dress themselves, and go
out on the green to see the fun.</p>

<h2>A FISH STORY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Cousin Willie</span> lives on a pleasant island in Chesapeake
Bay. He has a boat called the "Nautilus." One morning
he was taking a sail in his boat, when he saw a large fish-hawk
soaring and wheeling through the air, as though in
search of a breakfast for its young nestlings. At length it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
made a dive down to the water, and brought up a large
fish.</p>

<p>Just then an eagle that had been watching the fish-hawk
from the top of a tree, came swooping down toward the
hawk, as if determined to have the fish for his own breakfast.</p>

<p>The eagle attacked the hawk; and the two birds fought
for the fish until the hawk was forced to let it drop, when
the eagle made a rapid swoop, and caught the fish in his
talons.</p>

<p>Cousin Willie, from his boat, watched the fight of the
birds, and thought he would like to make the bold robber
give up his prey. So he shot at him with a pistol, and gave
him such a fright that he dropped the fish in his turn.</p>

<p>Willie picked up the fish, took it home, and laid it upon
a table in the kitchen to be cooked for dinner. But a sly
old cat saw it on the table, and, as no one was near to
prevent, she grabbed it quickly, and stole away with it to
give herself and her kittens a breakfast.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Thus the cunning puss and her kitties, you see,<br />
Got the better of those brave fishers three.<br />

<h2>BUTTERCUP'S CIRCUS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Fred</span> and Bertie, two little black-eyed boys, were visiting
their Aunt Susan in a beautiful country village. The
large, old-fashioned house, under a giant elm-tree, was full
of wonders to them; but their greatest delights were in
driving the old gray horse, or feeding and petting an
Alderney calf which their Uncle Harry was raising.</p>

<p>This "baby-cow," as little Bertie called her, was kept
away from its mother, old Clover, most of the day, and tied
to a cherry-tree in the side yard. The boys named her
Buttercup. They were allowed to feed her with meal and
water; and she soon grew so tame, that they could pat and
caress her as much as they pleased.</p>

<p>One day Fred found an old saddle in the stable; and he
proposed to Bertie to help him put it on the calf, and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a ride the length of her rope. They succeeded in fastening
it upon Buttercup's smooth back; and Freddie exclaimed
with delight, "Now we will have a first-class circus!"</p>

<p>They brought a chair from the house, and placed it by
the side of Miss Cow, she looking wonderingly at them with
great round eyes. The boys both stood together in the
chair, and Fred said, "Now I will count, and, when I say
<i>four</i>, we must spring upon the saddle. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four;"
and on they went.</p>

<p>But, before they could have said "<i>five</i>" Miss Buttercup's
heels were in the air, and her head went down so quickly,
that Master Fred felt a sudden chill, and found himself in a
tub of rain-water that stood under the eaves of the wood-shed;
while Bertie went head-foremost into a pan of meal
and water.</p>

<p>A slight noise followed their fall. Their uncle and aunt
appeared. The saddle was sent back to the stable, and the
boys did not engage Buttercup for any more circus performances
that summer.</p>

<h2>AT SEA.</h2>


<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Bark "Murray," Pacific Ocean</span>, December, 1876.<br />
</div>

<p><i>Dear Nursery</i>,&mdash;I am making a voyage, on a sailing
vessel from San Francisco to the Sandwich Islands. We
have been on the water for three weeks.</p>

<p>Every day at noon, if the sun shines, the captain comes
up on deck with a queer thing in his hand, which he calls a
sextant. With this he looks at the sun, and finds out just
where on this great ocean we are, and just how far we have
gone in the last twenty-four hours. To-day he says we are
three hundred miles from Honolulu.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus019.png" width="500" height="376" alt="At Sea." title="" />
</div>

<p>There are twenty sails on this ship. I love to lie down
on deck, and look at them; and I think it is a beautiful sight
to see them all spread and filled with wind. It almost seems
as if their tops touched the sky. All the masts and sails
and ropes have names. I am sure it would take me a good
while to learn them; but all the sailors know them.</p>

<p>When the captain wants a sail changed, he gives the
order in a very loud tone; then the first mate, who is never
very far from the captain, repeats the order; and then the
sailors run quickly to the ropes and pull away, and sing
while they pull; and the sail goes up or down, just as the
captain wants it.</p>

<p>Every hour a sailor takes his turn at steering the ship:
so there is always one man at the wheel. There is a large
bell swung just in front of him, which he strikes every half-hour
to mark the time. When it is twelve o'clock, he strikes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the bell eight times; and it is eight bells again at four
o'clock and at eight o'clock. The first hour after eight
bells is two bells; the second, four bells; the third, six
bells; and the half-hours strike the odd numbers,&mdash;three,
five, and seven bells. It is a very funny way to tell time, I
think.</p>

<p>One day the captain slung a hammock on deck, and we
had a nice time swinging in it. Another day, when the sea
was very calm, he hung a rope from the rigging, and made
a real swing for us. We have long fish-lines which we
throw over the ship's side. Once a gentleman on board
caught a beautiful dolphin, all green and blue and gold.
The steward made a nice chowder out of the dolphin for our
lunch, and we had baked dolphin for dinner that day.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Eve a little lamb was born on board. The
sailors named it "Thanksgiving," for the day. It is a dear
little lamb now,&mdash;so white and gentle! We have tied a
blue ribbon around its neck, and it will run all over the
deck after us, and go to sleep in our laps. There is a cunning
little pig, too, which I call "Dennis," after the pig
that I read about in "The Nursery." I wish it were really
the same wonderful little pig; but mamma says she does
not think it can be.</p>

<p>I must tell you about the beautiful bouquet the steward
made for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was made out of
vegetables with a knife&mdash;yellow roses from carrots, and
white roses, japonicas, and tuberoses from turnips and potatoes.
Some of the petals he dipped into beet-water, and so
made blush roses of them. Then he made two canary-birds
of carrots, and perched them among the flowers. Mamma
said that she had seen many a cluster of wax flowers that
were not as beautiful.</p>

<p>Perhaps I will write again when we arrive at Honolulu.</p>

<h2>SOLOMON AND THE TAME BEAR.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Uncle Reuben</span> was a farmer; and he had a great many
cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, geese, and turkeys, all of which,
you know, are usually found on a large farm; and, besides
these, he had one animal not usually found on a farm, and
that was a tame bear. He hired a large boy to do the
"chores," as the easy part of farm-work is called; and this
boy's name was Solomon Sturtevant.</p>

<p>Now, although the bear was tame, he was kept chained;
for there was no knowing what mischief even a tame bear
might take it into his head to do. He might take a notion
to find out how a nice tender pig would taste.</p>

<p>Solomon thought it fine sport to tease the bear, and there
was one way of doing it more amusing than any other, and
that was to pelt him with green chestnut-burs.</p>

<p>Chestnut-burs, you know, are covered with sharp thorns;
and yet the bear, being very fond of chestnuts, would try to
get at the nuts which he knew were in them,&mdash;snarling
and whining, and making up very comical faces, because the
burs pricked his mouth.</p>

<p>Solomon would stand and watch him, and think it fine
fun. But he came near doing it once too often; for
one day, when he had carried the bear a capful of burs,
intending to have a good laugh at him, the chain that held
the bear was not fastened as firmly as usual. After trying
two or three burs, the bear made a spring toward Solomon,
got loose from his chain, and started after him in earnest.</p>

<p>Solomon was not long in deciding that he had something
to do <i>that</i> time besides laughing, and started in a hurry to
get out of the bear's way. Now there was a ladder leaning
against the side of the barn close by, and Solomon thought
that if he went up on the barn-roof he would be all right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus023.png" width="500" height="377" alt="Bear on the ladder" title="" />
</div>

<p>No such thing. The bear went right up the ladder after
him. Then Solomon ran up the roof to the ridge; but
the bear followed. Solomon ran down the other side of the
roof, and so did the bear. Solomon jumped down to
the cow-house, and still the bear followed him. Then Solomon
jumped on to a shed that was close by the cow-house,
and the bear jumped too.</p>

<p>Solomon now began to think that his time had come.
He gave one more jump from the shed to the ground.
This was too much of a jump for the bear to take, and so
Solomon made good his escape.</p>

<p>I do not remember how the bear got down; but I am
sure, that, when he did, Solomon did not care to feed him
any more with green chestnut-burs. I think Solomon was
too glad to escape a hugging to try it very soon again.</p>

<p>This is a true story.</p>

<h2>AT DINNER.</h2>

Are just as good as they can be;<br />
Not often do three children dine,<br />
Who are as well-behaved as mine.<br />
<br />
I've taught them how to be polite,<br />
To keep their bibs all clean and white,<br />
To say, "Mee-oo" for "If you please,"<br />
And never to be cross, or tease.<br />
<br />
My darlings, Muff and Puff and Fluff,<br />
Stop always when they've had enough:<br />
They never come unwashed or late,<br />
They never crowd or push the plate.<br />
<br />
My care has not been vainly spent;<br />
That's why I purr with such content;<br />

<h2>SIXTH LESSON IN ASTRONOMY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever hear of a great bear and a little bear made
of stars? And a big dog? And a lion? If you never
did, I suppose you would like to be told where they are,&mdash;such
astonishing things as animals made of stars. But, if
you think a minute, you will see that every thing that has
any thing to do with stars must be up in the sky.</p>

<p>Now this very night, if the stars come out before you
go to bed, I want you to look for the Great Bear. It is not
a real bear, of course; but it is a kind of picture of a bear.
I wish it could growl, to give you an idea where it is,
because, it really looks so little like a bear, it is very hard to
find. It is nearly overhead now; but you needn't be a bit
frightened. The Great Bear has never been known to drop
down on little girls and boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a funny thing about this bear. Part of him is a
big dipper, and I think you will find him out by that. If
you can find the seven bright stars in the shape of a dipper,
you have found the bear's tail and a part of his body.</p>

<p>And now I want to tell you how it happens that these
stars are called the Great Bear. If you look up in the sky
some bright starlight night, you will see there a good many
different figures, in stars; and a long time ago, people gave
names to these figures. To one of them they gave the
name of the Great Bear; to another, the Little Bear; to
another, the Great Dog; and so on. These different star-figures
are called constellations. They really look very
little like the things they are named for: so I can't expect
you to find them without help.</p>

<p>Now, it is very convenient to have the stars divided up
in this way. When I asked you to find the red star last
winter, it would have been a great help to you if I had told
you what constellation it was in; but you might not have
known what I meant by a constellation.</p>

<p>I had so many pleasant letters about that red star, I am
going to ask you to write again when you find the Great
Bear, although I suppose most of you are abed and asleep
before he comes out for the night. He will appear earlier
when the days are shorter, and I do not believe he can
escape all your bright eyes. But I should advise you to ask
some one who knows where he is to point him out to you.</p>

<h2>TEDDY'S KITTEN.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">To</span> let the kitten lie and sleep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is something Teddy cannot do;</span><br />
Like caterpillar in a heap,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How just the look of her soft fur</span><br />
So tempts his little roguish hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cannot keep away from her:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He says he wants "to hear her purr!"</span><br />
<br />
And, if he does, 'tis well enough;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But then, why does he rub the way</span><br />
To make her silky coat look rough?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That coat of shining silver-gray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So washed and polished every day?</span><br />
<br />
Why is it that he loves so much<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To tickle the unconscious paws</span><br />
With just a finger tip or touch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or open them to find the claws?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>His</i> reason for it is, "Because!"</span><br />
<br />
When Teddy sometime wanted rest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What if a giant came and sat</span><br />
Beside him when he slept the best,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rolled him this way, rubbed him that,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And teased him, as he does the cat?</span><br />
<br />
Do you believe he'd smile and blink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bear the teasing patiently?</span><br />
I think he'd wink a sleepy wink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And say, not over pleasantly,</span><br />

<h2>THE CHAMOIS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chamois is a sort of antelope. But first let us say
something of the pronunciation of this word <i>chamois</i>. It
is often pronounced as if it were spelled <i>sham&acute;my</i>. This is,
perhaps, the easiest mode. But it would be nearer to the
French mode to pronounce it <i>sham-wah</i>, the last <i>a</i> having
the sound of <i>a</i> in <i>wall</i>.</p>

<p>The family of antelopes consists of nearly seventy species,
upward of fifty being found nowhere but in Africa. The
whole of America, North and South, contains but one
species. All the antelopes have a most delicate sense of
smell, and few quadrupeds can equal them in fleetness.
They will outrun the swiftest greyhounds.</p>

<p>The antelopes live in herds, and are very careful not to
be surprised: so they place sentinels to watch, and give
alarm. The eye, large and brilliant, is a marked feature of
the tribe. The word "antelope" signifies "bright eyes."</p>

<p>Our picture shows us several young chamois, standing
amid the crags and chasms and precipices which they
delight in. A chamois can descend in two or three leaps
a rock of twenty or thirty feet, without the smallest projection
on which to rest.</p>

<p>The horns of the full-grown chamois are quite black and
smooth, and formed like a perfect hook with very sharp
points. These elegant creatures are the only animals of
the antelope kind to be found in Western Europe. They
choose for their home the loftiest mountains.</p>

<p>They dislike heat, and in the summer time they frequent
the cold upper regions of the everlasting hills,&mdash;either the
lofty peaks, or those valleys where the snow never melts.
In the winter time, however, the cold of those bleak solitudes
seems too much for them, spite of their long, hair and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
thick coat of fine wool; and they descend to the lower
regions. It is then, and only then, that the hunter has any
chance of capturing them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus033.png" width="500" height="465" alt="Chamois" title="" />
</div>

<p>It is said they can scent a man a mile and a half off; and
their restlessness and suspicion are extreme. At the prospect
of danger they are off and away, racing at an incredible
speed, scaling crags with the most amazing agility, and
leaving the pursuer far behind.</p>

<p>They are usually taken by a party of hunters, who surround
the glen where they are, and advance towards each
other until the herd is hemmed in on all sides.</p>

<p>The flesh of the antelope is like venison. No animal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
ought to yield sweeter meat than the chamois, when we
think what he feeds upon. Mountain herbs and flowers,
and tender shoots from tree and shrub&mdash;such is his food.
He drinks very little, but that little is sparkling water;
while the air which reddens his blood is the purest in the
world.</p>
